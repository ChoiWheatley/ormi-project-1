## What you need to know...

I'm using Pure JS + Tailwind CSS, which depends on `tailwindcss` npx compiler [see](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

So before you fork and modify this project, make sure you running following command on terminal:

```shell
npx tailwindcss -i .\input.css -o .\output.css --watch
```
